# Robinhood.JS

Robinhood API for Node.JS - Documentation coming soon

Node.JS Framework to view portfolio information with the private [Robinhood](https://www.robinhood.com/) API. Using this API is not encouraged, since it's not officially available and it has been reverse engineered.
See @Sanko's [Unofficial Documentation](https://github.com/sanko/Robinhood) for more information.

This is a synchronous version of [aurbano/robinhood-node](https://github.com/aurbano/robinhood-node). Most methods besides the initial login method are extension methods.
